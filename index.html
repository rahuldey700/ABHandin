        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This project measures the user experience when booking a doctorâ€™s appointment on a website. The goal is to ensure the user can find and schedule appointments that best suit their needs. I optimized the control version A to create a new version B with the goal of helping users book their appointments faster and with fewer errors. I performed A/B testing to measure the improvement in user experience and although my version had fewer misclicks, it still took the user longer and more clicks in total to complete the task of scheduling.</p>
